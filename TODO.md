# Things that need doing

- Clean up snApi events in scope $destroy callbacks
- Split keymaps into platform specific groups, .platform-darwin, .platform-win32
- finish the file api
- Integrate contextual menu support
- Come up with a better way of querying dom structure and getting data from various scopes
  Start with the fileDisplay views directive first. The get bugger and active buffer service
  calls are messy and need a defined way about getting that sort of data from the dom.
